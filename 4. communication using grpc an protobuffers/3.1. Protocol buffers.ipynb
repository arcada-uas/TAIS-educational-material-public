    "# Protocol buffers\n",
    "\n",
    "For the communication between components and to enable one components output to become another components input, we will be using protocol buffers with grpc. To get a better understanding of these tools we will give a general introduction, first to protocol buffers and secondly how they can be used together with grpc to allow for the above mentioned communication and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a language-agnostic, platform-neutral mechanism for serializing structured data. It was developed by Google and is used extensively for data interchange, particularly in remote procedure calls (RPCs), configuration files, and data storage systems. Protobuf facilitates the efficient serialization of data into a compact binary format and deserialization back into structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Protocol Buffers, you start by defining your data structures in a .proto file. This file contains the schema for your messages, specifying fields and their types. Each field has a unique number, which is used to identify it in the binary format. Protocol Buffers \n",
    "not only allows you to define data structures but also supports the definition of services. A service in Protobuf specifies a set of remote procedure calls (RPCs) that can be executed remotely by a client application. This feature is particularly useful for creating distributed systems and APIs using gRPC. To define a service, you include a service block in your .proto file. This block specifies the service name and the RPC methods it provides, including their request and response message types.\n",

    "### Creating the protofile\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating the protofile you need to consider which methods, or services, should be available to the client, and what data that needs to be passed between the client and server in order to use those methods. The data that will be passed will be used to create the data structures. These are defined in so called message definitions. Each message contains a list of fields each with a unique number. Below you can see an example of a data structure called Person which includes the fields name, id and email.\n",
    "\n",
    "```proto\n",
    "message Person {\n",
    "  string name = 1; // Field 1: A string called 'name'\n",
    "  int32 id = 2;    // Field 2: An integer called 'id'\n",
    "  string email = 3; // Field 3: A string called 'email'\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, each field has a unique number that is used for binary encoding. Each field also contains the type of the data that should be saved to the field. You can see that the name and email expect strings, while the id expects an integer number. Other available types include int64 and bool. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a field to contain multiple values, like a list if numbers etc., then the field should be defined with the 'repeated' keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```proto \n",
    "message AddressBook {\n",
    "  repeated Person people = 1; // A list of 'Person' messages\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here you can see that the people field holds a list of \"Person\" messages and is therefor initialized with the repeated keyword. \n",
    "\n",
    "To define the methods that should be available, you need to use service definitions. Services define RPC methods that can be called remotely. Each RPC method specifies the request and response message types. Below you can see an example of a service called PersonService that provides the RPC method \"SummarizePerson\". The method takes a Person message as input and returns a Summary message which you can also see defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```proto\n",
    "syntax = \"proto3\";\n",

    "// Define the Person message\n",
    "message Person {\n",
    "  string name = 1;\n",
    "  int32 id = 2;\n",
    "  string email = 3;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Define the Summary message\n",
    "message Summary {\n",
    "  string info = 1; // Summary information about the person\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Define the PersonService with a single RPC method\n",
    "service PersonService {\n",
    "  rpc SummarizePerson (Person) returns (Summary);\n",
    "}\n",
