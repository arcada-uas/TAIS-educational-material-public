    "# Building Components for Machine Learning Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "This material is designed to guide you through the process of creating components for machine learning (ML) pipelines using the AI on Demand website. It encompasses seven comprehensive sections, each addressing a distinct aspect of the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover both the essential tools required and provide concrete examples to illustrate each step of the process. Our aim is to make the creation of ML pipeline components more accessible, even for those without extensive expertise in machine learning. By leveraging the AI Builder platform, you will be able to share and integrate these components to construct innovative and effective ML pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope this material will empower you to develop and contribute to ML pipelines with greater ease and confidence.\n"
