    "Having developed and tested the services for each component, we are now ready to move on to the next phase: enabling communication between these components using gRPC and Protocol Buffers. This process involves several steps, including writing a .proto file, generating the gRPC code, and implementing both the gRPC server and client with the generated code. Given the complexity and the number of steps involved, this process can be challenging, especially for those who are unfamiliar with these technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you navigate this, we have provided foundational information on Protocol Buffers and gRPC before diving into the practical example. It is recommended that you review these materials thoroughly, as they will give you a deeper understanding of how gRPC and Protocol Buffers function, which will, in turn, enhance your comprehension of the example.\n"
