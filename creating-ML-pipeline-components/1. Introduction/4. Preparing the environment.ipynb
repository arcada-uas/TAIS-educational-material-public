    "\n",
    "In order to run the examples provided in this material, you will need to use some tools and technologies. This means that you will need to download some tools and configure your machine according to the requirements. Below is a list of the necessary tools for running the examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- github\n",
    "- Visual Studio Code or similar IDE\n",
    "- python, venv\n",
    "- docker\n",
    "- all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file in the project\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in order to use the playground app for deployment, there are some additional requirements that will be brought up in the deployment chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Github will be used to copy the example code onto your local machine where it can be tested and edited. In order to edit the code you will need some sort of code editor that also allows you to run and test the code locally. We recommend visual studio code, but other similar IDEs can also be used. To install git and visual studio code, and copy the examples to your local machine, follow the instructions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Visual Studio Code and Github\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install Git\n",
    "- Git is a version control system required to clone repositories from GitHub.\n",
    "- Download Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads\n",
    "- Install Git by following the installation instructions for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code\n",
    "- VS Code is a popular code editor that integrates well with Git.\n",
    "- Download VS Code from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/download\n",
    "- Install VS Code by following the installation instructions for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Set Up GitHub Account\n",
    "- If you don't have a GitHub account, you need to create one.\n",
    "- Sign up for GitHub at [github.com](https://github.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Clone the Repository and Open it in VS Code\n",
    "- The example code can be found in the github repositry linked on this website. In the upper right hand corner there's a little github icon. If you press it you will be taken to the github repository. This icon is available from any of the pages on this website, so if you ever need to revisit the repository you can do so easily through the icon. To copy the repository, press the icon, and go to the repository. Once you have been redirected to the github repository you should see a green button labeled \"code\". If you press it, a menu should pop up with cloning options. Simply choose the HTTPS option and copy the web address.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using Git CLI:\n",
    "    - Open a terminal and go to the directory into which you want to place the copied repository\n",
    "    - run the following command:\n",
    "    - git clone https://github.com/arcada-uas/TAIS-educational-material-public.git\n",
    "    - once it is copied, you can right click the folder and pick open with code. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Using Visual studio Code GUI:\n",
    "    - open vs code\n",
    "    - Press ctrl+shift+P or simply write \">\" in the search bar on top of the page to open the command palette (see picture below)\n",
    "    - Start writing git clone and press it when you see it\n",
    "    - Enter the web address into the command palette\n",
    "    - pick a directory into which the project should be copied and open the project\n",
    "\n",
    "![github clone in vs code](./pic1.4.1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final step: revise the code\n",
    "- Once you have all of the code copied to your local machine and are able to open the project with vs code, you can look through the folders. You might notice that the folders are named in the same way that the chapters on the webpage are named. The example corresponding to a specific chapter is of course going to be located in the folder of the same name. We will go through the examples in detail in later chapters, so you don't need to familiarize yourself with the code too much right now. However, you might want to look at the next step already at this point. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python and venv\n",
    "The examples all use the python language, so if you haven't used python on your machine before, we recommend following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install Python\n",
    "- Ensure that Python is installed on your system.\n",
    "- Download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "- Install Python and ensure the option to add Python to your PATH is selected during installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Install Python Extension for VS Code\n",
    "- To enhance your Python development experience in VS Code, install the Python extension.\n",
    "- Open VS Code\n",
    "- Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.\n",
    "- Search for Python and install the extension provided by Microsoft.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)\n",
    "- A virtual environment helps manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects.\n",
    "- Open the terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+``).\n",
    "- Navigate to the root of your project directory.\n",
    "- Create a virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python -m venv .venv\n",
    "\n",
    "- activate the environment:\n",
    "    Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "    Linux/MacOS: source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Install Project Dependencies\n",
    "- Since the project includes a requirements.txt file, use it to install dependencies.\n",
    "- With the virtual environment activated, run:\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Configure the Python Interpreter in VS Code\n",
    "- Ensure that VS Code uses the correct Python interpreter.\n",
    "- Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).\n",
    "- Type and select Python: Select Interpreter.\n",
    "- Choose the interpreter from your virtual environment (it should be listed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should be able to run the python code!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker\n",
    "Further down the line you will also need docker in order to test the examples. Docker is a platform that enables developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers that can run virtually anywhere. To donwload docker, visit the Docker Installation Page: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/. Choose your operating system from the list (Windows, macOS, Linux) and follow the step-by-step instructions provided for your specific operating system. This typically involves downloading the Docker Desktop installer for Windows and macOS, or using a package manager for Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the docker installation you should be ready for the first 5 chapters' examples. In the deployment chapter we will provide further instructions for how to comply to the specific requirements for the playgruond app. \n",
