    "Containerization involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a self-contained unit called a container. This process begins by defining the application environment and specifying its dependencies, including libraries, frameworks, and runtime components.\n",

    "In the realm of containerization, Docker serves as a powerful tool for building, running, and managing containers across various environments, including servers and the cloud. Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container.\n",

    "Using Docker for containerization, developers create a Dockerfile or a similar configuration file that outlines the steps needed to build the container image. In this Dockerfile, developers specify the base image to use, copy the application code into the image, and configure any additional settings or dependencies required for the application to run.\n",
