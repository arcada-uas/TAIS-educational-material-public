1. is the way I'm using webhooks correct?
    - forwarding the data to the next service
    - should I instead send a get request to the previous component to trigger the service and get the required parameters?
    - does it matter?

2. In the material, should I focus on one method for testin the web applications
    - postman, cmd line, web browser?

3. Should we test the components individually before connecting?
    - how will i get the required parameters?
