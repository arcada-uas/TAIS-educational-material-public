    "# Local deployment using the playground app\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use the playground app, developed as part of the AI builder project, to deploy your pipeline, you can follow these instructions. You will need to have completed the previous steps of uploading the components to the AI builder platform, connecting them and downloading the resulting solution.zip file before continuing with these steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the playground app you will need to first clone it from the githb repository:\n",
    "https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/graphene/playground-app\n",
    "\n",
    "Save it to your local machine and open the project in visual studio code or similar IDE. Next, we will generate a CSR and Private Key Using OpenSSL as these are needed in order to run the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "A CSR (Certificate Signing Request) is a message sent from an applicant to a Certificate Authority (CA) to apply for a digital certificate. It contains the public key that will be included in the certificate and information about the applicant's identity (such as their domain name). \n",
    "\n",
    "The private key is a cryptographic key that remains confidential and is used to decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key. Together, the CSR and private key are used to establish secure communication channels, such as HTTPS for websites, ensuring data privacy and integrity.\n",

    "Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the playground app\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Clone the code from the repository to your local machine and open the project.\n",
    "2) Install Minikube\n",
    "- You can install minikube using the instructions for your operating system found on this page: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Flinux%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download\n",
    "- check that the installation was successful:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    minikube version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3) start minikube\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    minikube start\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- This will initialize a local kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "4) Install kubectl\n",
    "- kubectl is the kubernetes command line tool.\n",
    "- You can follow the installation guid for yout operating system found on this page: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/\n",
    "- test that the installation was successful:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    kubectl version --client\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5) Log in to docker\n",
    "- make sure you have docker installed\n",
    "- check that docker is running:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    sudo systemctl status docker\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- start docker if it's not active:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    sudo systemctl start docker\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- login:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    docker login\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "6) Start virtual environment and install dependencies:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    PLAYGROUND_VENV=~/.grpc\n",
    "    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 $PLAYGROUND_VENV\n",
    "    source $PLAYGROUND_VENV/bin/activate\n",
    "    pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "7) Place solution.zip file in project and change the code accordingly\n",
    "- Take a look at the code in exampleObjectModels.py\n",
    "- The code specifies a path for the solution.zip\n",
    "- You can edit the path to fit your requriements\n",
    "- Add the solution.zip file to a path that matches what you defined in the exampleObjectModels.py file:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    mkdir -p  /path/to/pathsolutionZips/solutionID\n",
    "    cp solution.zip /path/to/pathsolutionZips/solutionID/\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "8) Run exampleObjectModels.py \n",
    "- In order to run the exampleObjectModels.py, you're going to have to comment out a line in the python.py file which can be found in the folder objectModelPlayground. Comment out the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    flags += f\" --config-file {os.getcwd()}/config.json \"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    in the function __run_kubernetes_client_script function, then run:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    python exampleObjectModels.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "9) check pipeline status\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    kubectl get ns\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- The namespace starting with the pipeline name should contain the running pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "10) verify pod status\n",
    "- check that pods are running within the namespace:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    kubectl get pods -n <namespace>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- the output will be a table listing the pods in the specified namespace. Each row represents a pod, and the columns provide information about the pod's status. In the status column you should see \"RUNNING\"\n",
    "\n",
    "11) Change config.json file to contain the path to your ssl certificate\n",
    "- use the sample-config.json as a template. Copy it's contents into a file named config.json\n",
    "- Save your ssl certificate and key to the project directory\n",
    "- Update cert.pem and key.pem inside config.json:\n",
    "    \"https_chain\": \"/path/to/cert.pem\",\n",
    "    \"https_key\": \"/path/to/key.pem\"\n",
    "\n",
    "12) Finding and applying the correct username\n",
    "In order to successfully run the app and see the deployed solution, you need to find the username of the session and apply it to the path of the deployed solution. In order to do this, you will need to add a printing statement that prints the username of the current session. This can be done by adding the following line: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"-----------------------------\", session.get('username'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "to line 109 in the views/__init__.py file. Here is a screenshot of what it looks like in the code:\n",
    "![playground app ss](./pic6.2.1.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, when you run the app using the command ```shell python app.py``` you should see a line resembling the following be printed:\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------- 12345678910\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashes are only there to make it easier to find the print. You might have to open the webapplication for the app in order for the print to get executed. Once you figure out the username connected to the session, you will need to edit the path to the deployed solution. As a default, the path might be something like \"solutions/User1\". You will need to replace \"User1\" with the number sequence that got printed previously, so for example \"solutions/12345678910\". This way you should be able to see the deployed pipeline once you open the dashboard after running the python app.py command. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13) Run the app\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    python app.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - this command should redirect you to the playground dashboard. If it doesn't you should be able to find the link to the dashboard in the terminal. The pipeline should now be up and running.\n",
    "    - If you can't see any deployed solutions, then go back to the previous step and double check that the directory matches the session username. \n",
