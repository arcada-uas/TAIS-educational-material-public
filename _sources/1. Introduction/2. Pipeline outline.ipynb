    "# Creating a Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, a pipeline in this context is a machine learning pipeline consisting of different components responsible for different parts of the machine larning process. We have defined a few steps for creating the necessary components and connecting them to create the final pipeline. In order to complete these steps it is important that you have atleast a basic understanding of the different technologies and tools used and how they work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to create a pipeline are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Identify the problem, Objectives and Deliverable items\n",
    "The first step to create a pipeline is to identify the problem, what you need the pipeline for. Once you have a clear understanding of the needs and requirements, it is easier to make a good decision on what components are necessary and how to implement them. By defining the problem and objectives clearly you should be able to identify the deliverable items. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Create the outline of the pipeline\n",
    "Next you will need to clearly define how many components are needed and what each component should do. You should also decide on the required technologies, such as programming languages, for the components. When defining the components it is especially important to define the input and output of each of the components, as these are what connects the components together. For example the output from one component, such as a data cleaning component, will become the input of the next component, like the training component, when processing through the pipeline. Defining the inputs and outputs clearly also simplifys the coding as you have a clearer understanding of what is expected of each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Implementing the components\n",
    "The third step is to start implementing the components. This includes writing the service code, testing the services, writing protofiles for each of the components, generating and integrating grpc code and containerizing the components using docker. We will cover the creation of components in a later chapter as this includes quite a few steps and tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "After defining a component it is important to test it carefully before trying to connect it to the other components, to ensure that the functionality has been implemented correctly and to simplify the debugging process once the components have been connected. Testing the components both individually and togehter throughout the entire creation process is imortant to ensure a reliable solution. We will also cover the testing in a later chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Uploading the dockerimages\n",
    "Once you have ensured that all components work well both separatly and together on your local computer, you can containerize the applications and register them to Docker Hub. This step requires that you have defined the dockerfile for each of the components. Uploading to Docker Hub is done to simplify the process of uploading the components to the AI builder platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Connect the components in AI builder\n",
    "When the components have been finalized and uploaded to Docker Hub you can use the AI builder platform to upload and connect the different components. This will create a deployable pipeline contained in a solution.zip file which will be provided by the platform to download. You will need to download the zip file in order to complete the following steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Running the playground app locally\n",
    "In order to deploy the pipeline you will need to configure the playground app provided as part of the AI builder project for local deployment. This will be covered in a later chapter. \n",
