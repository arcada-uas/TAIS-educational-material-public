    "# Local deployment using the playground app\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use the playground app, developed as part of the AI builder project, to deploy your pipeline, you can follow these instructions. You will need to have completed the previous steps of uploading the components to the AI builder platform, connecting them and downloading the resulting solution.zip file before continuing with these steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the playground app you will need to first clone it from the githb repository:\n",
    "https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/graphene/playground-app\n",
    "\n",
    "Save it to your local machine and open the project in visual studio code or similar IDE. Next, we will generate a CSR and Private Key Using OpenSSL as these are needed in order to run the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "A CSR (Certificate Signing Request) is a message sent from an applicant to a Certificate Authority (CA) to apply for a digital certificate. It contains the public key that will be included in the certificate and information about the applicant's identity (such as their domain name). \n",
    "\n",
    "The private key is a cryptographic key that remains confidential and is used to decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key. Together, the CSR and private key are used to establish secure communication channels, such as HTTPS for websites, ensuring data privacy and integrity.\n",

    "## Running the playground app\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Clone the code from the repository to your local machine and open the project.\n",
    "2) Install Minikube\n",
    "- You can install minikube using the instructions for your operating system found on this page: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Flinux%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download\n",
    "- check that the installation was successful:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    minikube version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3) start minikube\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    minikube start\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- This will initialize a local kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "4) Install kubectl\n",
    "- kubectl is the kubernetes command line tool.\n",
    "- You can follow the installation guid for yout operating system found on this page: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/\n",
    "- test that the installation was successful:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    kubectl version --client\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5) Log in to docker\n",
    "- make sure you have docker installed\n",
    "- check that docker is running:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    sudo systemctl status docker\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- start docker if it's not active:\n",

    "- Take a look at the code in exampleObjectModels.py\n",
    "- The code specifies a path for the solution.zip\n",
    "- You can edit the path to fit your requriements\n",
    "- Add the solution.zip file to a path that matches what you defined in the exampleObjectModels.py file:\n",

    "8) Run exampleObjectModels.py \n",
    "- In order to run the exampleObjectModels.py, you're going to have to comment out a line in the python.py file which can be found in the folder objectModelPlayground. Comment out the line:\n",
    "\n",

    "9) check pipeline status\n",
    "    ```shell\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "- The namespace starting with the pipeline name should contain the running pipeline\n",

    "10) verify pod status\n",
    "- check that pods are running within the namespace:\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    kubectl get pods -n <namespace>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- the output will be a table listing the pods in the specified namespace. Each row represents a pod, and the columns provide information about the pod's status. In the status column you should see \"RUNNING\"\n",
    "\n",
    "11) Change config.json file to contain the path to your ssl certificate\n",
    "- use the sample-config.json as a template. Copy it's contents into a file named config.json\n",
    "- Save your ssl certificate and key to the project directory\n",
    "- Update cert.pem and key.pem inside config.json:\n",
