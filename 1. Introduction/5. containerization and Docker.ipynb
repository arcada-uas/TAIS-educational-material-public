    "Containerization involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a self-contained unit called a container. This process begins by defining the application environment and specifying its dependencies, including libraries, frameworks, and runtime components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of containerization, Docker serves as a powerful tool for building, running, and managing containers across various environments, including servers and the cloud. Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container.\n",

    "Using Docker for containerization, developers create a Dockerfile or a similar configuration file that outlines the steps needed to build the container image. In this Dockerfile, developers specify the base image to use, copy the application code into the image, and configure any additional settings or dependencies required for the application to run.\n",

    "Before we can start building our own ML pipeline components and containerize them, let's look at a more simple example to get an understanding for how to containerize an app. \n",

    "\n",
    "docker desktop download page: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to containerize your application you need to create a dockerfile, and for running the app you need a compose.yaml file. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the folder \"1.5containerization_example\" you can find an example app that we are going to containerize. Here's a brief overview of the files in the folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "    package.json: This file manages installation of packages required by the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "    app.js: this file is a java script file and implements the application logic and routes. It contains the server code to start a web server using Express and serve the static HTML page.\n",
    "\n",
    "    index.html: This file provides the web page content.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the dockerfile and the compose.yaml file we can use docker's built in command \"docker init\". This command has to be run in the project folder containing the app, so in our case it's the \"1.5containerization_example\" folder. When running this command docker will create all the necessary files for containerization. Follow these instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the terminal, change to the 1.5containerization_example directory\n",
    "2. run the \"npm install\" command. This should generate a \"package-lock.json\" file which servers as a lockfile that captures the exact versions of packages and their dependencies.\n",
    "3. run the \"docker init\" command\n",
    "    This command will open the Docker Init CLI. You will be asked a few questions that you need to answer. Here are the questions and the necessaary answers:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    ? What application platform does your project use? Node\n",
    "\n",
    "    ? What version of Node do you want to use? {enter the version you have installed} \n",
    "\n",
    "    ? Which package manager do you want to use? npm\n",
    "\n",
    "    ? What command do you want to use to start the app? node app.js\n",
    "\n",
    "    ? What port does your server listen on? {for example 3000}\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    After the command has finished, you should be able to see the dockerfile, the compose.yaml file, a README.Docker.md file and a .dockerignore file. These files have been generated for you\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the docker init command finishes successfully you should now be able to run the containerized application. Run the command \"docker compose up --build\". You should now be able to view the app on the port you selected.\n",
